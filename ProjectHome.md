Let X and Y be two categorical variables with finite cardinalities |X| and |Y|.  We observe a set of pairs {xi, yi} drawn IID from the joint distribution of X and Y.  The basic idea behind CODE and related methods is to represent (embed) each value of X and each value of Y as points in a common low dimensional Euclidean space such that values that frequently co-occur lie close to each other.  S-CODE further restricts these points to lie on the unit sphere.  Please see the following papers for a description.
